    This function downloads a file into the snapshots folder and outputs the

        output_folder: Root folder where snapshot, intermediate and tables will be placed.
        ext: Force extension when creating output file, handy when it cannot be guessed from URL.

            file would have been downloaded. If the file does not exist, this flag is ignored.
