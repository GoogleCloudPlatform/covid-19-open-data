# COVID-19 Open Data

This repository contains datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 for 50+ countries
around the world. The data is at the spatial resolution of states/provinces for most regions and at
county/municipality resolution for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Mexico,
Netherlands, Peru, United Kingdom, and USA. All regions are assigned a unique location key, which
resolves discrepancies between ISO / NUTS / FIPS codes, etc. The different aggregation levels are:
* 0: Country
* 1: Province, state, or local equivalent
* 2: Municipality, county, or local equivalent
* 3: Locality which may not follow strict hierarchical order, such as "city" or "nursing homes in X
  location"

There are multiple types of data:
* Outcome data `Y(i,t)`, such as cases, tests, hospitalizations, deaths and recoveries, for region i and time t
* Static covariate data `X(i)`, such as population size, health statistics, economic indicators, geographic boundaries
* Dynamic covariate data `X(i,t)`, such as mobility, search trends, weather, and government interventions

The data is drawn from multiple sources, as listed [below](#sources-of-data), and stored in separate
csv / json files, which can be easily merged due to the use of consistent geographic (and temporal)
keys.

<sup>1</sup> `key` is a unique string for the specific geographical region built from a combination
of codes such as `ISO 3166`, `NUTS`, `FIPS` and other local equivalents.\
<sup>2</sup> Refer to the [data sources](#sources-of-data) for specifics about each data source and
the associated terms of use.\
<sup>3</sup> Datasets without a `date` column contain the most recently reported information for
each datapoint to date.

For more information about how to use these files see the section about
[using the data](#use-the-data), and for more details about each dataset see the section about
[understanding the data](#understand-the-data).



## Why another dataset?

There are many other public COVID-19 datasets. However, we believe this dataset is unique in the way
that it merges multiple global sources, at a fine spatial resolution, using a consistent set of
region keys. We hope this will make it easier for researchers to use. We are also very transparent
about the [data sources](#sources-of-data), and the [code](src/README.md) for ingesting and merging
the data is easy to understand and modify.

## Use the data

The data is available as CSV and JSON files, which are published in Google Cloud Storage so they can
be served directly to Javascript applications without the need of a proxy to set the correct headers
for CORS and content type.

For the purpose of making the data as easy to use as possible, there is a [main](#main) table
which contains the columns of all other tables joined by `key` and `date`. However,
performance-wise, it may be better to download the data separately and join the tables locally.

Each region has its own version of the main table, so you can pull all the data for a specific
region using a single endpoint, the URL for each region is:
* Data for `key` in CSV format: `https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/${key}/main.csv`
* Data for `key` in JSON format: `https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/${key}/main.json`

Each table has a full version as well as subsets with only the last day of data.
The full version is accessible at the URL described [in the table above](#open-covid-19-dataset).
The subsets can be found by appending `latest` to the path. For example, the subsets of the main
table are available at the following locations:
* Latest: https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/latest/main.csv
* Time series: https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/main.csv

Note that the `latest` version contains the last non-null record for each key. All of the above
listed tables have a corresponding JSON version; simply replace `csv` with `json` in the link.

If you are trying to use this data alongside your own datasets, then you can use the [Index](#index)
table to get access to the ISO 3166 / NUTS / FIPS code, although administrative subdivisions are
not consistent among all reporting regions. For example, for the intra-country reporting, some EU
countries use NUTS2, others NUTS3 and many ISO 3166-2 codes.

You can find several examples in the [examples subfolder](examples) with code showcasing how to load
and analyze the data for several programming environments. If you want the short version, here are a
few snippets to get started.

### BigQuery
This dataset is part of the [BigQuery Public Datasets Program][22], so you may use BigQuery to run
SQL queries directly from the
[online query editor](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_open_data&page=dataset).

### Google Colab
You can use Google Colab if you want to run your analysis without having to install anything in your
computer, simply go to this URL: https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data.

### Google Sheets
You can import the data directly into Google Sheets, as long as you stay within the size limits.
For instance, the following formula loads the latest epidemiology data into the current sheet:
```python
=IMPORTDATA("https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/latest/epidemiology.csv")
```
Note that Google Sheets has a size limitation, so only data from the `latest` subfolder can be
imported automatically. To work around that, simply download the file and import it via the File
menu.

### R
If you prefer R, then this is all you need to do to load the epidemiology data:
```R
data <- read.csv("https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/main.csv")
```

### Python
In Python, you need to have the package `pandas` installed to get started:
```python
import pandas
data = pandas.read_csv("https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/main.csv")
```

### jQuery
Loading the JSON file using jQuery can be done directly from the output folder,
this code snippet loads the epidemiology table into the `data` variable:
```javascript
$.getJSON("https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/epidemiology.json", data => { ... }
```

### Powershell
You can also use Powershell to get the latest data for a country directly from
the command line, for example to query the latest epidemiology data for Australia:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest 'https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v2/latest/epidemiology.csv' | ConvertFrom-Csv | `
    where key -eq 'AU' | select date,total_confirmed,total_deceased,total_recovered
```



## Understand the data

Make sure that you are using the URL [linked at the table above](#covid-19-open-data) and not the
raw GitHub file, the latter is subject to change at any moment in non-compatible ways, and due to
the configuration of GitHub's raw file server you may run into potential caching issues.

Missing values will be represented as nulls, whereas zeroes are used when a true value of zero is
reported.

For information about each table, see the corresponding documentation linked
[above](#covid-19-open-data).

### Main table
Flat table with records from all other tables joined by `key` and `date`. See below for information
about all the different tables and columns. Tables not included in the main table are:
* [WorldBank](./docs/table-worldbank.md): A subset of individual indicators are added as columns to other
  tables instead; for example, the [health](./docs/table-health.md) table.
* [By Age](./docs/table-by-age.md): Age breakdowns of epidemiology and hospitalization data are normalized and
  added to the by-age-normalized table instead (TABLE TO BE ADDED).
* [By Sex](./docs/table-by-sex.md): Sex breakdowns of epidemiology and hospitalization data are normalized and
  added to the by-sex-normalized table instead (TABLE TO BE ADDED).

### Notes about the data
For countries where both country-level and subregion-level data is available, the entry which has a
null value for the subregion level columns in the `index` table indicates upper-level aggregation.
For example, if a data point has values
`{country_code: US, subregion1_code: CA, subregion2_code: null, ...}` then that record will have
data aggregated at the subregion1 (i.e. state/province) level. If `subregion1_code`were null, then
it would be data aggregated at the country level.

Another way to tell the level of aggregation is the `aggregation_level` of the `index` table, see
the [schema documentation](./docs/table-index.md) for more details about how to interpret it.

Please note that, sometimes, the country-level data and the region-level data come from different
sources so adding up all region-level values may not equal exactly to the reported country-level
value. See the [data loading tutorial][7] for more information.
